a :=  (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36);


ay :=CPraise(a,comps);

ax :=  CPflat(ay,comps);

It's not actually a bug, since a violates partitions in wreath product.

similarly Z2 w Z2 case:

a := (1,2,3,4);
ar := CPraise(a,comps);
arf :=CPflat(ar,comps;)

but the raising and flatting use backwards significant digits:
b := (3,2,4,1); # corresponds to +1 in binary
and equals the flattening of its raised version.
  current      binary backwards-binary so current = backwards-binary +1 
    1      00   0         0
    2      01   2         1
    3      10   1         2
    4      11   3         3
 (top down 01, means first branch by 0 then by 1).
